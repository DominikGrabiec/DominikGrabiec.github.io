Earlier in May of this year I came across a call for submissions for the [Game Development track at CppCon](https://cppcon.org/cfs2024-gamedevchair/). Having had the loose idea for a talk in my head for the longest time I submitted a last minute proposal, and to my delighted surprise they accepted it!

The talk is titled ["Techniques to Optimise Multi-threaded Data Building During Game Development"](https://cppcon2024.sched.com/event/1gZg6/techniques-to-optimise-multithreaded-data-building-during-game-development), and I know it's quite a mouthful but they said to be detailed.

This will be my first big public presentation and I am honoured to have been selected. So now I am deep into preparing and practicing the presentation, writing, coding, editing, and everything else that comes with it. I'll see what I can release publicly after the conference but at least the slides will be available on the CppCon github, and if I can I'll post something on my own Github.

If you happen to be at the conference then I would be delighted if you would attend my talk, and if not then please say hi!
