Hi my name is Dominik and I've been programming for a couple of decades now, starting in High School, learning more at University, and then actually learning a lot in the workforce.

My main focus has been on high performance C++ programming, although I have dabbled in some web development using Ruby, and worked with embedded devices both professionally and as a hobby.
